[ml2_cisco]

# (StrOpt) A short prefix to prepend to the VLAN number when creating a
# VLAN interface. For example, if an interface is being created for
# VLAN 2001 it will be named 'q-2001' using the default prefix.
#
# vlan_name_prefix = q-
# Example: vlan_name_prefix = vnet-

# (BoolOpt) A flag to enable round robin scheduling of routers for SVI.
# svi_round_robin = False

#
# (StrOpt) The name of the physical_network managed via the Cisco Nexus Switch.
# This string value must be present in the ml2_conf.ini network_vlan_ranges
# variable.
#
# managed_physical_network =
# Example: managed_physical_network = physnet1

# Cisco Nexus Switch configurations.
# Each switch to be managed by Openstack Neutron must be configured here.
#
# Cisco Nexus Switch Format.
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<IP address of switch>]
# <hostname>=<intf_type:port>       (1)
# ssh_port=<ssh port>               (2)
# username=<credential username>    (3)
# password=<credential password>    (4)
#
# (1) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Nexus physical port (interface) it is connected to.
#     Valid intf_type's are 'ethernet' and 'port-channel'.
#     The default setting for <intf_type:> is 'ethernet' and need not be
#     added to this setting.
# (2) The TCP port for connecting via SSH to manage the switch. This is
#     port number 22 unless the switch has been configured otherwise.
# (3) The username for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (4) The password for logging into the switch to manage it.
#
# Example:
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:1.1.1.1]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=ethernet:1/2
# compute3=port-channel:1
# ssh_port=22
# username=admin
# password=mySecretPassword

[ml2_cisco_apic]

# Hostname:port list of APIC controllers
# apic_hosts=1.1.1.1:80, 1.1.1.2:8080, 1.1.1.3:80

# Username for the APIC controller
# apic_username=user

# Password for the APIC controller
# apic_password=password

# Names for APIC objects used by Neutron
# Note: When deploying multiple clouds against one APIC,
#       these names must be unique between the clouds.
# apic_vmm_domain=openstack
# apic_vlan_ns_name=openstack_ns
# apic_node_profile=openstack_profile
# apic_entity_profile=openstack_entity
# apic_function_profile=openstack_function

# The following flag will cause all the node profiles on the APIC to
# be cleared when neutron-server starts. This is typically used only
# for test environments that require clean-slate startup conditions.
# apic_clear_node_profiles=False

# Specify your network topology.
# This section indicates how your compute nodes are connected to the fabric's
# switches and ports. The format is as follows:
#
# [switch:<swich_id_from_the_apic>]
# <compute_host>,<compute_host>=<switchport_the_host(s)_are_connected_to>
#
# You can have multiple sections, one for each switch in your fabric that is
# participating in Openstack. e.g.
#
# [switch:17]
# ubuntu,ubuntu1=1/10
# ubuntu2,ubuntu3=1/11
#
# [switch:18]
# ubuntu5,ubuntu6=1/1
# ubuntu7,ubuntu8=1/2
